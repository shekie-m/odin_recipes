# odin_recipes
This project is aimed to creating a website of recipes.
I will employ a variety of HTML elements and attributes for the structure of the website.
I will use the links and images elements, the paragraph elements, the different types of headings, lists both ordered and unordered among other HTML elements.
This website may lack style and font changes since i am only working with HTML for now.
